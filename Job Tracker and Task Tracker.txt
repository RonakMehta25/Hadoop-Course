Job Tracker and Task Tracker

They are part of hadoop version 1 

They are replaced by Resource Manager,Application Master in Hadoop Version 2


1. Client applications submit jobs to the Job tracker.

2. The JobTracker talks to the NameNode to determine the location of the data.

3. The JobTracker locates TaskTracker nodes with available slots at or near the data.

4. The JobTracker submits the work to the chosen TaskTracker nodes.

5. The TaskTracker nodes are monitored. If they do not submit heartbeat signals often enough, they are deemed to have failed and the work is scheduled on a different TaskTracker.

6. A TaskTracker will notify the JobTracker when a task fails. The JobTracker decides what to do then: it may resubmit the job elsewhere, it may mark that specific record as something to avoid, and it may may even blacklist the TaskTracker as unreliable.

7. When the work is completed, the JobTracker updates its status.

8. Client applications can poll the JobTracker for information.
