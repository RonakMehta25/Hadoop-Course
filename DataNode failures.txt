DataNode failures

NameNode periodically receives a Heartbeat (signal) from each of the DataNode in the cluster, which implies DataNode is functioning properly.

A block report contains a list of all the blocks on a DataNode. If a DataNode fails to send a heartbeat message, after a specific period of time it is marked dead.

The NameNode replicates the blocks of dead node to another DataNode using the replicas created earlier.
