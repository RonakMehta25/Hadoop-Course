NameNode is down

The NameNode recovery process involves the following steps to make the Hadoop cluster up and running:

Use the file system metadata replica (FsImage) to start a new NameNode. 
Then, configure the DataNodes and clients so that they can acknowledge this new NameNode, that is started.
Now the new NameNode will start serving the client after it has completed loading the last checkpoint FsImage (for metadata information) and received enough block reports from the DataNodes.
