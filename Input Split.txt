Input Split

InputSplit in Hadoop MapReduce is the logical representation of data.

Hadoop InputSplit represents the data which is processed by an individual Mapper.

The split is divided into records. Hence, the mapper process each record

Inputsplit does not contain the input data; it is just a reference to the data.

InputFormat creates the Inputsplit and divide into records

Thus the number of map tasks is equal to the number of InputSplits.

map task passes the split to the createRecordReader() method on InputFormat to get RecordReader for the split and RecordReader generate record (key-value pair), which it passes to the map function.
