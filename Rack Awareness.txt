Rack Awareness

Rack Awareness is the algorithm in which the “NameNode” decides how blocks 
and their replicas are placed, based on rack definitions to minimize network 
traffic between “DataNodes” within the same rack. 

Let’s say we consider replication factor 3 (default), 
the policy is that “for every block of data, two copies will exist in one rack, third copy in a different rack”. 
This rule is known as the “Replica Placement Policy”.
